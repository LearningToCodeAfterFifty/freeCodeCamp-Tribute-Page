This is the second of five projects found at https://freecodecamp.org/learn/ to obtain a "Responsive Web Design Certification".

- Apply what I learned in the courses.

- Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests to complete this project.
- Later on, return to this project and make modifications to improve as I learn more.
